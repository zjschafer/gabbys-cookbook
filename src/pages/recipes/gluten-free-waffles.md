Golden and homemade, these light and fluffy gluten-free waffles look irresistibly crisp on the outside and tender in the center, fresh from the waffle iron. A soft dollop of freshly churned butter melts into the warm pockets, adding a rich, creamy sheen that highlights their airy texture. Juicy berries—strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries—are scattered on top for bright pops of color and natural sweetness, while a few mint leaves add a fresh, fragrant garnish. The result is a cozy, wholesome breakfast that feels both comforting and special, perfect for savoring slowly.
