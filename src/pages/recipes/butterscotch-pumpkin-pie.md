This pumpkin pie takes a classic favorite and elevates it with the warm, caramel-like sweetness of butterscotch chips folded into the silky filling. Each bite delivers smooth, spiced pumpkin balanced by pockets of rich butterscotch that melt gently on the palate, adding depth without overpowering the traditional flavors. The filling is luxuriously creamy, perfectly set, and finished with a soft swirl of whipped topping that adds a light, airy contrast to the pie’s comforting richness.

What truly makes this pie special is my secret—though not so secret—gluten-free crust, made completely from scratch. It bakes up beautifully golden and flaky, shattering delicately with each forkful just like a crust made with regular flour. Crisp at the edges and tender underneath the filling, it provides the perfect foundation without any hint that it’s gluten free. The result is a pie that tastes familiar and indulgent, proving that homemade, gluten free baking can be every bit as decadent and satisfying as the original.
