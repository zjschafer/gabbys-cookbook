This homemade vanilla pudding tastes luxuriously rich and comforting, with a depth of flavor that only pure vanilla bean can provide. Each spoonful is silky-smooth and decadently creamy, melting effortlessly on the tongue while releasing warm, fragrant notes of real vanilla. The gentle sweetness is perfectly balanced, allowing the natural richness of the milk and cream to shine without being overpowering. Tiny flecks of vanilla bean add both visual beauty and an extra layer of flavor, making every bite feel thoughtfully crafted and indulgent. It’s the kind of dessert that feels both simple and elegant—soft, velvety, and deeply satisfying from the first taste to the last. The best part? It's gluten free, of course!
